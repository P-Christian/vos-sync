/**
 * GET /api/school-admin/course-requests
 *
 * Role-authorized, exactly-scoped School Admin inbox. The SCHOOL_ADMIN role
 * and the exact-one active assignment are resolved server-side BEFORE any
 * request or course query. Returns exactly
 * `{ inbox: { schoolId, routed, finalizing, courses } }` for the caller's own
 * school: actionable `RoutedToSchool` decisions, recoverable claim-locked
 * `RoutedToSchool` finalizing rows, and Active same-school candidates. No
 * other school's rows or courses are disclosed, and no requester
 * identity beyond the name-only label is exposed.
 *
 * The name-only `submitterName` label is attached here at the route boundary,
 * keeping the domain module identity-free: the allowlisted fields are domain
 * parsed first, and the resolved label is spread in only after that parse has
 * already succeeded.
