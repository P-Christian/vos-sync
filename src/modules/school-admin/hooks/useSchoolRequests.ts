/**
 * Client-side state for the School Admin attendance inbox.
 *
 * Consumes the school-request API as-is:
 *   GET  /api/school-admin/school-requests          -> { inbox: { schoolId, schoolAdminId, routed[], finalizing[] } }
 *   PATCH /api/school-admin/school-requests/{id}    -> { result }  (strict discriminated approve/reject body)
 *   POST /api/school-admin/school-requests/reconcile-> { recovered[], count } (idempotent)
 *
 * Every fetch passes `cache: "no-store"` so a persistent browser profile can
 * never serve a stale inbox or another school's cached rows.
 *
 * The server DTO is privacy-limited; these client types mirror it structurally
 * because the server types module is `server-only` and must never be imported
 * by client code. Each row additionally carries the name-only `submitterName`
 * label supplied by the HTTP boundary; no email or other profile field is ever present.
 *
 * Recovery semantics enforced by the API contract:
 *   - 409 -> REFRESH the inbox; NEVER surface a success state.
 *   - 404 -> the row is terminal/foreign/absent; REMOVE it from the inbox.
 *   - 503 on approve -> the claim/finalize may have committed but the response
 *     was lost; surface Finalizing and offer ONLY `resume` of the persisted
 *     reviewer/time decision. Academics are fixed on the roster row at
 *     creation and are never re-sent by resume.
